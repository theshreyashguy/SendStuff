## Architecture

### System Design
1. **Scalability**:  
   The system is designed to handle high traffic with the following technologies:
   - **MongoDB**: Used as the primary database for user, driver, and booking data.
   - **KafkaJS**: For streaming large amounts of location data efficiently in real time.
   - **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data such as price estimations and user sessions.
   - **Kubernetes**: Used to scale services horizontally and ensure high availability.
2. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - WebSockets or MQTT for live tracking and instant job updates.
